# Matrix Rank and Nullspace Analysis

## 📖 Overview
This project implements Gaussian elimination to compute the reduced row echelon form (RREF) of matrices. It analyzes their ranks and nullspaces to understand the relationships between matrices in terms of linear independence and dimensionality.

## 🚀 Features
- Gaussian elimination algorithm for matrices
- Calculation of reduced row echelon form (RREF)
- Rank and nullspace dimension analysis
- Example matrices to demonstrate functionality

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy library

## 📥 Installation
To set up the environment, clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
